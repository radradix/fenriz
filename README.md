# Fenriz
Fenriz is a Discord bot that incorporates GPT-2 to complete user input. 

## General info
I applied my admittedly shoddy knowledge of Python to the development of Fenriz. I wanted to learn how to use both Python and GPT-2 in my own self-directed environment. I want to understand still more. 

To talk to Fenriz, format your input like `fn hello`. 

## Technologies used
This project was created using the following: 
* GPT-2 (an open-source language model)
* Python
* Javascript
* [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
* Nodemon

## Project status
Fenriz was up for a little while, but there are currently significant issues I need to work out. Presumably this is because of deprecation of some dependencies.
